## Expectations

### If you’re reading through this top to bottom, here is what you can expect to get out of this article:

#### 1. Learn to build a professional quality data analysis dashboard, completely in python using the Dash / Plotly frameworks using a non-standard data set.
#### 2. Obtaining the data.
#### 3. Understanding the data and the challenges it will pose.
#### 4. Methods used to manipulate the data in various forms.
#### 5. Construction of the dashboard framework to view and analyze the data.
#### 6. Developing several distinct chart types using plotly libraries to visualize the data in different ways.


## Requirements
### To work through this article, you will need several things that are all easily avialable:

### Computer that can run Python (at least version 3.7 though I developed this using python 3.9)
### The modules listed in the “requirements.txt” file
#### Some nice-to-haves, but not specifically required is a Fed API Key for updating the data using the pull_fed_data.py script.
